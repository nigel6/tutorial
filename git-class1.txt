Git is version history for codes or projects
It allows us to save past versions of our codes
We can check version history in Git
There are two main areas in Git
Staging area is where Git keeps changes that have been picked to go into next version
Working area is where all changes we are working on, not yet committed.
Git branching points to the latest commit in the branch
